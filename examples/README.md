# ZX Spectrum Jetpac Example

The loading screen from the ZX Spectrum can be used as an example of how the
alignment of graphical elements along 8-pixel boundaries can reduce the number
of tiles needed to re-produce an image on the Sega Master System.

In its original format, it would require 433 tiles to reproduce the image on
the SMS screen. After the changes this was reduced to just 426 unique tiles.
With further editing this could certainly be improved upon.

A reduction of 7 tiles may not seem much, but with a maximum of 448 tiles
available in the Master System VDP memory, every tile counts!
